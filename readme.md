# EDA Project on Airbnb Dataset

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the Airbnb dataset. The goal of this project is to gain insights and understand the patterns and trends within the Airbnb data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Airbnb dataset, which contains information about Airbnb listings, including details such as location, pricing, amenities, and reviews. The dataset can be obtained from [insert dataset source link here].

## EDA Process

The EDA process involves the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data consistency.

2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Various exploratory techniques are applied to the dataset, including:
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Data visualization (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, etc.)
   - Correlation analysis
   - Geographic analysis (if location data is available)

3. **Insights and Findings**: Based on the exploratory analysis, insights and findings are derived, highlighting patterns, trends, and potential areas for further investigation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `airbnb.csv`: This directory contains the Airbnb dataset files.
- `airbnb.ipynb`: This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks with the EDA code and analysis.
